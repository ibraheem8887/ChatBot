# 🤖 Empathetic Chatbot using Transformers  


> A Transformer-based chatbot built **from scratch** in PyTorch — designed to understand emotions and respond with empathy 💬💙  

---

## 🧩 Introduction  

Most chatbots can answer questions — but they often *miss the emotion*.  
This project explores how **Generative AI** can make chatbots more *human-like and emotionally aware*.  

I implemented a **Transformer Encoder–Decoder** architecture from scratch, trained it on emotion-labeled dialogue data, and deployed it using **Streamlit** for real-time interaction.

## 🎯 Objective  

To design and train an empathetic chatbot capable of:  
- Understanding **emotion-tagged conversations**  
- Generating **context-aware and emotionally aligned replies**  
- Providing an **interactive chat interface** for real-time use

## 🏗️ Project Overview  

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Dataset Preprocessing** | Cleaned and structured the `emotion_emotion_69k` dataset |
| **Tokenizer** | Trained a custom **SentencePiece BPE** tokenizer (vocab = 8,000) |
| **Model** | Implemented **Transformer Encoder–Decoder** from scratch |
| **Training Pipeline** | Managed with **YAML configs** and **TensorBoard** tracking |
| **Web App** | Built with **Streamlit** for real-time chatting |
| **Advanced Decoding** | Implemented *temperature*, *top-k*, and *beam search* sampling |
